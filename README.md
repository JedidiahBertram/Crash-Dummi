## The Story Behind the App...
The idea for Crash Dummi was originally born when I got hit by a car.

Thats right. 2 and a half weeks into my WebDev bootcamp at Galvanize I was hit by a car during my ride into class. It was one of the scariest moments of my life. What was most frightening about it was that the situation was completely out of my control, as the driver was at fault, and claimed she just did not see me coming. A story I all to often hear about motorist/cyclist collisions. I began brainstorming on how I could use the skills I would develop at galvanize to prevent collisions like mine from happening.

I eventually came up with the idea to create an app that would update cyclist locations for drivers on a map in real time, and also alert drivers to a cyclists presence when a cyclist is in close proximity to their current location.

Months later, the app got the name Crash Dummi and I set to work on it for my capstone presentation.

It was an especially daunting task as I wanted to make Crash Dummi a mobile app. I chose to develop the app initially in Swift using xCode as I have always been a fan of apple products, and iOS. The stack I decided on included these technologies, as well as Cocoa Pods, FireBase, and MapBox.

I knew nothing about any of these technologies before I started the project, and had just two weeks to complete the MVP of the app.

I studied my pants off, and started to code. It was slow going at first, but as I got more familiar with all of the tech, I started solving more problems every day, and feeling great about myself!

The result is Crash Dummi as it works today. A functional app, that performs the aforementioned tasks exactly as it should! See the following gifs for more info on how it works, or, watch the youtube videos linked to the images below.
